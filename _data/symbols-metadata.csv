At the very top of the logo is the sentence ""hail the order."" The shield is lined in yellow, with its interior being white and black. Within it is a cross with the word ""fyrduns,"" which translates to ""the army of the people."" Above the cross is the name of the hate group in German, ""Bruder Schweigen"" (Silent Brotherhood). There is an axe peeking out from behind the shield in the upper right-hand corner. Above this is a long ribbon that goes all the way over the shield and axe. On it is written the sentence ""Thou art my battle axe and weapon of war,"" which is a biblical reference. The next passage following this in the Bible would say ""for with thee I will break in pieces the nations, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms."" Depending on the logo you are looking at, it might be black and white without the square frame, or with the red/black frame as described at the beginning. ","The history of coats of arms begins in the medieval West. It started with the invention of the emblematic system based on the blazon - a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image - that was described and studied by heraldry. <br><br>Coats of arms first appeared between 1120 and 1160, combining elements from signs, banners, seals, coins, and shields to create the final result. These may include individual, family, and fiefdom emblems. The Plantagenet enamel, often dated 1160-1165, which shows the coat of arms of Geoffroy Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, is the earliest known heraldic representation in colour. <br><br>The spreading and popularity of coats of arms was believed to have been caused due to an issue with military equipment. Since the equipment at the time no longer made it possible to recognize the identity of combatants and, most certainly, thanks to the fashion for tournaments. <br>","Coats of arms were created in early medieval Europe, allowing participants in tournaments, as well as knights clad in military equipment, to easily be identified. With time, coats of arms evolved to denote family descent, adoption, alliance, property ownership, and eventually, profession. <br><br>In the 17th to 19th centuries, arms were embellished to record personal or family history, often in ways that ignored the traditions of hearldry's origins. They could also be designed for organizations far removed from war to symbolize the meanings of their mottoes or to hint at their histories.<br>",White supremacists; terrorist group; white revolution; Neo-Nazi; Neo-Facism; Christian Identity; white separatists; white nationalist; domestic terrorist; insurrectionist,coat of arms; battle axe,,,,,,,

Within the shield you will see the letter ""A"", on the right which stands for ""Aryan"" and a ""B"" on the right for ""Brotherhood/brothers"", at the bottom there is the word ""Texas"" spelt out as well, and in the middle of the shield you will notice a swastika with a sword going through it, and on top of the sword, a crown. Majority wise this symbol is shown through tattoos, so namely they are black and white, although I have noticed sometimes you will see red incorporated into the letters of ""Aryan"".","A' for Aryan. 'Blood and soil"" was an early slogan used in Germany to evoke the idea of a pure ""Aryan"" race, which means a ""pure white, non-Jewish"" race of European origin or decent, especially if you had blonde hair and blue eyes. Basically, it is seen as the superior racial group. <br>'B' for brotherhood.<br>""Texas"" for the location. <br>Although the Colour red does not always appear, when it does it more than likely represents nazi colours, red, black, and white.<br>Although Swastikas in earlier times had its own sacral meanings such as prosperity and good fortune, the Aryan brotherhood of Texas was adopted in the 1980's, after world war 2, where the swastika has been transformed into a hateful sign, being adopted by Hitler as his symbol for The National Socialist Party (or NAZI), where it was transformed for a symbol of violence, military brutality, fascism, and genocide. <br>","Coat of arms shield usually represents Heritage, family ties, and alliance, It was used in medieval times not only for protection but also for the purpose of identification within battle.<br>Typically, when there is a coat of arms shield, if it incorporates a sword, the sword is facing downwards, which is the case in this logo. Swords were obviously used to fight with, although within the coat of arms, was usually used to symbolize bravery and honour. <br>There is also the crown which is on top of the sword at the top of the coat of arms. Not only used in the context of kings but was used as a symbol of victory or success over others. <br>","White supremacist; Neo-Nazi",,,,,,,,
