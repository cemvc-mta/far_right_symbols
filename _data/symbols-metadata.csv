At the very top of the logo is the sentence ""hail the order."" The shield is lined in yellow, with its interior being white and black. Within it is a cross with the word ""fyrduns,"" which translates to ""the army of the people."" Above the cross is the name of the hate group in German, ""Bruder Schweigen"" (Silent Brotherhood). There is an axe peeking out from behind the shield in the upper right-hand corner. Above this is a long ribbon that goes all the way over the shield and axe. On it is written the sentence ""Thou art my battle axe and weapon of war,"" which is a biblical reference. The next passage following this in the Bible would say ""for with thee I will break in pieces the nations, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms."" Depending on the logo you are looking at, it might be black and white without the square frame, or with the red/black frame as described at the beginning. ","The history of coats of arms begins in the medieval West. It started with the invention of the emblematic system based on the blazon - a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image - that was described and studied by heraldry. <br><br>Coats of arms first appeared between 1120 and 1160, combining elements from signs, banners, seals, coins, and shields to create the final result. These may include individual, family, and fiefdom emblems. The Plantagenet enamel, often dated 1160-1165, which shows the coat of arms of Geoffroy Plantagenet, Count of Anjou, is the earliest known heraldic representation in colour. <br><br>The spreading and popularity of coats of arms was believed to have been caused due to an issue with military equipment. Since the equipment at the time no longer made it possible to recognize the identity of combatants and, most certainly, thanks to the fashion for tournaments. <br>","Coats of arms were created in early medieval Europe, allowing participants in tournaments, as well as knights clad in military equipment, to easily be identified. With time, coats of arms evolved to denote family descent, adoption, alliance, property ownership, and eventually, profession. <br><br>In the 17th to 19th centuries, arms were embellished to record personal or family history, often in ways that ignored the traditions of hearldry's origins. They could also be designed for organizations far removed from war to symbolize the meanings of their mottoes or to hint at their histories.<br>",White supremacists; terrorist group; white revolution; Neo-Nazi; Neo-Facism; Christian Identity; white separatists; white nationalist; domestic terrorist; insurrectionist,coat of arms; battle axe,image/png,,,,,,

Within the shield you will see the letter ""A"", on the right which stands for ""Aryan"" and a ""B"" on the right for ""Brotherhood/brothers"", at the bottom there is the word ""Texas"" spelt out as well, and in the middle of the shield you will notice a swastika with a sword going through it, and on top of the sword, a crown. Majority wise this symbol is shown through tattoos, so namely they are black and white, although I have noticed sometimes you will see red incorporated into the letters of ""Aryan"".","A' for Aryan. 'Blood and soil"" was an early slogan used in Germany to evoke the idea of a pure ""Aryan"" race, which means a ""pure white, non-Jewish"" race of European origin or decent, especially if you had blonde hair and blue eyes. Basically, it is seen as the superior racial group. <br>'B' for brotherhood.<br>""Texas"" for the location. <br>Although the Colour red does not always appear, when it does it more than likely represents nazi colours, red, black, and white.<br>Although Swastikas in earlier times had its own sacral meanings such as prosperity and good fortune, the Aryan brotherhood of Texas was adopted in the 1980's, after world war 2, where the swastika has been transformed into a hateful sign, being adopted by Hitler as his symbol for The National Socialist Party (or NAZI), where it was transformed for a symbol of violence, military brutality, fascism, and genocide. <br>","Coat of arms shield usually represents Heritage, family ties, and alliance, It was used in medieval times not only for protection but also for the purpose of identification within battle.<br>Typically, when there is a coat of arms shield, if it incorporates a sword, the sword is facing downwards, which is the case in this logo. Swords were obviously used to fight with, although within the coat of arms, was usually used to symbolize bravery and honour. <br>There is also the crown which is on top of the sword at the top of the coat of arms. Not only used in the context of kings but was used as a symbol of victory or success over others. <br>",White supremacist; Neo-Nazi,,image/png,,,,,,

An empty circle is in the background (it's a thick, black circle that is not filled in) with a cross over top. The cross is also in black ink with a blank lining. The cross is the same as a high cross (or standing cross). Instead of straight lines, the inner corners where all parts of the cross meet rounds out instead of being a sharp line. Thus, instead of creating a 90 degree angle in the four inner corners of the corss, it creates a semi-circle.","A high cross (or standing cross) is a free-standing Christian cross made of stone and often highly decorated. It is believed that these were made mostly of wood, perhaps metalwork attachments, and earlier pagan Celctic memorial stones. The Pictish stones of Scotland (a type of monumental stele, generally carved or incised with symbols or designs) may also have influenced the form. The earliest surviving examples would appear to come from to Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. It remains unclear whether it was first developed in Ireland or Britain. These crosses were erected just outside churches and monasteries; others at sites that may have marked boundaries or crossroads, or preceded churches. While it is still unclear whether they were used as preaching crosses at early dates, it does not seem they were used as grave-markers in the early medieval period. ","Although the first high cross appeared in the ninth century (aprx.) being a product of the Irish monastic community, they continued to be carved well into the twelfth century and onwards. There was a unique Early Medieval tradition in Ireland and Britain of raising these large sculpted stone crosses, usually outdoors. In general, a high cross would typically used as boundary markers of significant territories or sacred land and as monuments to political power during the Medieval period. That being said, one could assume that the Western Guard Party chose to adapt this sacred emblem in their logo to indicate their power and ownership of ""sacred land."" From a modern perspective, there have been various large modern versions of high crosses erected for various functions starting in the 19th century. Celtic crosses then became popular for invidiual grave monuments, usually featuring only abstract onament, usually interlace. In 1887, the Reverand William Slater Caverly commissioned a replica life-sized copy of Fogforth cross and had it placed in the churchyard at Aspatria, Cumbria. In the 21st century, the Irish scultptor Brendan McGloin was commissioned by the ANcient Order of Hibernians, Portland to handcraft a full size replica of the Clonmacnoise Cross of the Scriptures. it was completed in 2007 and shipped to Donegal to Portland, Oregan where it will stand as a Famine memorial.

In general, a high cross would typically used as boundary markers of significant territories or sacred land and as monuments to political power during the Medieval period. That being said, one could assume that the Western Guard Party chose to adapt this sacred emblem in their logo to indicate their power and ownership of ""sacred land."" From a modern perspective, there have been various large modern versions of high crosses erected for various functions starting in the 19th century. Celtic crosses then became popular for invidiual grave monuments, usually featuring only abstract onament, usually interlace. In 1887, the Reverand William Slater Caverly commissioned a replica life-sized copy of Fogforth cross and had it placed in the churchyard at Aspatria, Cumbria. In the 21st century, the Irish scultptor Brendan McGloin was commissioned by the ANcient Order of Hibernians, Portland to handcraft a full size replica of the Clonmacnoise Cross of the Scriptures. it was completed in 2007 and shipped to Donegal to Portland, Oregan where it will stand as a Famine memorial. There exist various other instances like this one where high crosses were commissioned for a reason or another in the 21st century.

A shield-shape is in the background, filled in with the colors of the German Empire flag (black, white, red). The colors have a brick-effect, making the shield look like a brick wall. In the middle there is a grey gear wheel, and overtop that, two crossed hammers. The hammers are also in the colors of the German Empire flag (black, white red). ","The name and symbol of the Hammerskin Nation came from The Wall, a 1979 album by the rock group Pink Floyd that was made into a film in 1982. The Wall tells the story of Pink, a rock singer who becomes a drug addict, loses his grip on reality and turns to fascism. Pink performs a song in which he expresses a desire to line all of the ""queers,"" ""Jews,"" and ""coons"" in his audience ""up against the wall"" and shoot them. In obvious references to the Holocaust, he sings of the ""final solution"" and ""waiting to turn on the showers and fire the ovens."" The swastika is replaced by Pink's symbol: two crossed hammers, which he boasts will ""batter down"" the doors behind which frightened minorities hide from his fascist supporters. Though Pink Floyd does not support fascism, the Hammerskin Nation has made real the gruesome fantasy depicted in the band's film: racist rock music and racially motivated violence under a banner bearing two red, white and black crossed hammers","""Coats of arms were created in early medieval Europe, allowing participants in tournaments, as well as knights clad in military equipment, to easily be identified. With time, coats of arms evolved to denote family descent, adoption, alliance, property ownership, and eventually, profession. <br><br>In the 17th to 19th centuries, arms were embellished to record personal or family history, often in ways that ignored the traditions of hearldry's origins. They could also be designed for organizations far removed from war to symbolize the meanings of their mottoes or to hint at their histories.<br>""",white supremacy; Neo-Nazism; White supremacism; White nationanislm; Antisemitism; homophobia,German Empire; Hammerskin; rock group; white power rock; Crew 38,image/png,,,,,,
